Social Media Wisdom is a Flask-based web platform that helps users understand and improve their relationship with social media. By analyzing Instagram data exports and questionnaire responses across four key categories (social connections, goal focus, self-worth, and moderation), the application generates personalized recommendations using LLM technology, based on cutting edge social media wisdom research.

Still a work in progress. Currently trying various LLMs that would give users an informative and seamless experience. Using Flask, Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript for this project. This project is intended to be a portfolio piece only. (for now)
