                        <h3>Ethan Luchs</h3>
                        <p>I am a student at Virginia Tech majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Human-Computer
                            Interaction.
                            This project was created as part of my exploration into how we can better understand
                            our relationships with social media through data-driven insights and self-reflection. If you have
                            any questions, comments, or concerns regarding this website, feel free to reach out to me.</p>

            <h2>Research Background</h2>
            <p>This project was inspired by research in the fields of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Digital Wellbeing: Understanding how social media usage patterns affect mental health and personal
                    relationships</li>
                <li>Self-Reflection Through Data: Using personal data to gain insights into behavior patterns and habits
                </li>
                <li>Human-Computer Interaction: Designing interfaces that encourage mindful technology use</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Key research that influenced this project includes studies on social comparison on social media,
                the impact of Instagram on self-esteem, and strategies for maintaining healthy digital boundaries.</p>
